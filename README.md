# ðŸŒ¸ Hello and welcome to my Hub! ðŸŒ¸

![Grethe_Bs ](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=GretheB90&color=blueviolet)

My name is Grethe and I'm from Norway but currently living in Denmark Copenhagen with my boyfriend and two cats, Kenta and Kenji.
For the most of my life I've been striving to become an artist fulltime, but as things have changed and plans needing adjustments for futureproofing,
I've started to take my steps into the world of IT to supplement my art and general living-

Specifically within Cybersecurity and analysis.

This has led me down a path I never imgined I would take!
It has been quite interesting, educational but also a challenge.

Thanks to my friends who many work within the field, I've learned a lot and started building up confidence.

My previous experience with anything IT and web is mostly from common use of my own PC usage and from being a digital artist and studied
in webdesign/multimedia. This time I'm conducting this study on my own, not under a education system.
Currently I've used mostly resources from Online to progress and by asking peers I know who works in the industry and friends who
enjoy the world of IT and learned more than what I could have imagined.

On this page I will showcase my projects and scripts I've made in Python for cyber security so far.
